# Problem Description
xyzSoft is a software house providing services and products for several clients. Project managers at xyzSoft uses an enterprise application (called E_Manage) to manage these ongoing projects during the various stages. However, E_Manage does not provide proper reporting capabilities. Instead, it allows exporting data in Excel format (Multiple Workbooks). The Quality Management Department at xyzSoft usually spend long time trying to process these exported files to come up with insights about the running projects. Ahmad (from Quality Management Department) contacted you to help him in this long and time-consuming process. He provided few samples containing projects information. For each project, there is a list of stages which are stored in a different workbook.
